Test Coverage with intellij idea 


dateCalculator	100% (1/1)	100% (1/1)	92% (12/13)
Deductable	100% (1/1)	100% (1/1)	75% (6/8)
MonthOutOfBoundsException	100% (1/1)	100% (1/1)	100% (2/2)
YearOutOfBoundsException	100% (1/1)	100% (1/1)	100% (2/2)

The code coverage in netbeans was problematic and only gave me 0%**

*I run all my tests with parameters.
Also I added a zip of the project in case there is a 
problem with the imports, as I had when I coped my project in the git repo...
