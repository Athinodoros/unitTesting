The unit testing for question 1 is under : 

Test Packages -> testDate ->JunitTestDayCalc.java

The unit testing for question 2 is under : 

Test Packages -> testDeductible ->JunitTestDeductible.java

And finally the code coverage did not work well on my netbeans (jacoco)
and for some reason I was geting 0% coverage all the time


*I run all my tests with parameters.
